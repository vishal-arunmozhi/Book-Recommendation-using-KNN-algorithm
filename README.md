# Book recommendation using KNN algorithm

- This repository features a simple book recommendation project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/book-recommendation-engine-using-knn) implemented with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
- The project utilizes the [Book-Crossings](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) dataset and employs Pandas for data import and preprocessing. The core functionality involves using the Nearest Neighbors module from scikit-learn to develop a model capable of recommending five similar books based on a given book title.
